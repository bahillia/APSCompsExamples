# Green Peas and HST-COS Cross Dispersion
My Comps was looking at existing observations of Green Pea Galaxies with HST-COS and trying to pull spatial data or evidence of extended emission from these observations. I largely found nothing, although the galaxies all demonstrate a significant lyman alpha halo.

I won the Chambliss Award for this poster, although I think that was mostly due to it being accessible and recording narration for all my boxes.

# Committee Members
Nils, Erica Nelson, Ann-Marie Madigan, Brian Fleming, Lauren Blum. If you want dirt, text me directly I'm not posting it online.

# Other Important Notes
I almost failed my comps, which was due to a couple of factors, but largely me being an instrumentation student and slamming it together in two-ish months. If you too are pressed for time, contact me and I may be able to give you more advice.
