# APSCompsExamples

Immortalizing comps resources for future years. Since CU killed our Google Drive access I decided this was probably the best place to host things. If you have materials you want to add submit a pull request! If you don't know how I have a tutorial for that [here](https://github.com/kirklong/ASTR_6000_Workshop). GitHub limits *individual* file sizes by default to 50 MB, but you can add larger files using Git Large File Storage &mdash; follow [these](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github) instructions to set that up if you need (I had to do this for my PowerPoint as it was graphics heavy so was ~70 MB). 

Currently we have examples from [Pat Behr](Pat), [Marcel Corchado](marcel), [Kenny Kenny](kenny), [Cole Tamburri](Cole), [Alex Haughton](Alex), and [myself](Kirk), which you can read more about at the READMEs in their respective folders. Hopefully others will contribute as well, but feel free to reach out and bug any other upper years personally for their materials if you're interested in seeing their stuff but they haven't uploaded it here yet.
